# Azure Blockchain dApps events

## Goal: Create a dApp that will showcase reactions to events surfaced by state changes in blockchain


The challenge was to create a decentralized application with the VS Code extension, that will be comprised of at least one Smart Contract that will raise an event in response to a state change. The extension will also be used to create a Blockchain Data Manager on Azure application that the ReactJS application that will listen for these events and provide a toast notification to the app if a specific state change occurs.
